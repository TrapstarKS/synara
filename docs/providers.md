# Providers

Synara does not host models or sell a separate model subscription. It operates supported
coding-agent runtimes installed and authenticated on your machine, then presents them through one
consistent workspace.

Provider availability can differ between the current stable release and development builds. Use the
provider settings in your installed Synara version as the authoritative list for that build.

## What Synara manages

Synara provides the shared operating surface around each provider:

- Project and task ownership
- Provider and model selection
- Conversation and tool activity
- Approvals and user-input requests
- Terminal, browser, file, and diff surfaces
- Git environments and checkpoints
- Session continuation where supported
- Provider handoffs
- Usage information where the provider exposes it

## What remains provider-owned

The provider still controls:

- Installation
- Authentication
- Account and subscription limits
- Model availability
- Tool behavior
- Permission semantics
- Service availability
- Provider-specific session features

A provider working in its own terminal is an important prerequisite, but not a guarantee that every
provider feature is supported through Synara.

## Connect a provider

1. **Install the official runtime.** Use the provider's official installation instructions.
2. **Authenticate outside Synara.** Complete the provider's normal sign-in or credential setup.
   Verify the runtime from a fresh terminal.
3. **Open Synara provider settings.** Confirm that the provider is detected and enabled. When
   necessary, configure a custom path to the provider executable.
4. **Check model discovery.** Open the model picker and confirm that the expected models and options
   appear. Synara discovers many provider capabilities at runtime; the result can depend on the
   installed CLI version, account, subscription, and provider configuration.
5. **Start a small test task.** Use a harmless objective in a test repository before relying on a
   newly configured provider for important work.

## Models and effort options

Providers expose different selection models:

- A fixed catalog
- A catalog discovered from the installed runtime
- User-configured custom models
- Reasoning, effort, mode, or variant options
- Account-dependent availability

Synara normalizes these choices into the composer where possible without pretending that every
provider has identical capabilities.

Favorite models can be surfaced above larger catalogs, and supported provider executables can be
pointed at custom binary locations.

## Provider sessions

Each task owns a provider session.

The session may preserve provider-specific behavior such as:

- Plans
- Tool calls
- Approvals
- Reasoning summaries
- Context usage
- Model changes
- Resume or reconnect behavior
- Provider-native subagents or workflows

Capabilities vary. Do not assume a control available for one provider exists for all of them.

## Switching providers

A [provider handoff](https://www.trysynara.com/docs/workflows/handoffs) allows another provider to
continue the task and work in the same environment with the context Synara passes to it.

Use handoffs deliberately. Review the working tree before and after changing providers so ownership
remains clear.

## When a provider is missing

Check these in order:

1. Does the executable run from a fresh terminal?
2. Is the provider authenticated?
3. Is the expected executable on `PATH`?
4. Is a custom binary path configured incorrectly?
5. Does the installed runtime version support the required integration?
6. Does restarting Synara refresh the provider status?
7. Does the provider itself report a service or account error?

Continue with the [troubleshooting hub](https://www.trysynara.com/docs/troubleshooting) when the
runtime works independently but remains unavailable in Synara.

Use the dedicated [provider guides](https://www.trysynara.com/docs/providers) for exact
installation, authentication, verification, capabilities, update paths, and provider-specific
failure checks.

## Codex asynchronous questions

On Codex versions and models that expose `request_user_input_async`, Synara shows
a persistent pending-question panel above the composer, plus a question-mark
capsule in the transcript. The panel counts unanswered questions, including those
from earlier turns and older than the ordinary transcript window. Opening a question reuses
the same question form as blocking prompts: numbered choices, previous/next
navigation, and a separate text answer. Closing the capsule preserves the current
answer draft. The composer and transcript share that draft, including navigation
between chats in the same window, and cannot submit the same answer simultaneously.
A suggested answer is never submitted automatically. The composer
remains available and the agent can continue working while the question is unanswered.

The shared form keeps blocking prompts' existing auto-advance behavior. Async
questions require an explicit submission and scope keyboard shortcuts to the
opened form, so separate questions and the main composer cannot consume each
other's input.

Questions and submitted answers are stored with the assistant message. Refreshing
or restarting Synara restores that state; unfinished drafts are local to the current
window. Finishing or interrupting a turn does not dismiss an unanswered asynchronous
question. Concurrent submissions are admitted once
by the server; a second client refreshes the accepted answer. Normal turn-delivery
errors remain visible on the conversation, as for any other user message.

Space badges aggregate individual thread states. An unanswered question or approval
has priority over another thread's ongoing work, including within the same project.
Amber means attention is needed, red means a run failed, blue pulses while work is
active, and green means an unread completed reply. The currently opened thread does
not contribute an unread-completion badge. A Space without a badge is idle; its
tooltip spells out the current status. Asynchronous questions use **Needs Answer**
without treating the provider as blocked.

### Streaming delivery

Text deltas remain visible while the provider works. A completed, identified Codex
agent-message item supplies the authoritative final text, repairing missing or
replayed deltas while preserving whitespace. Legacy completions without item IDs
retain their existing fallback behavior. Text accompanying a question remains
visible alongside its question form.

The presentation animation buffers at most 320 received characters. Large arrivals
skip to that live tail instead of replaying many seconds of simulated typing.
Completion, reduced motion, and returning after a paused animation show the received
text immediately. Intermediate reveals do not split UTF-16 surrogate pairs.

Codex command/tool activity follows the same live transcript model without turning
every provider chunk into a new row. Running tool runs stay individually visible;
settled adjacent runs may collapse behind a summary disclosure. Command output is
projected while the command is still running using bounded cumulative snapshots,
then reconciled with the completed item. Expanding a command shows its raw command,
working directory when available, output, exit code, and duration.

Native v2 MCP and dynamic-tool items preserve the provider's exact identity and
payload for inspection. The compact row uses the app/action label when Codex supplies
`appContext`, otherwise the MCP server/tool or namespace/tool identity. Expanding it
shows server/namespace, exact tool name, arguments, textual/structured result, error,
and duration when present. MCP progress messages update the existing call by item id
instead of replacing its identity or creating an unrelated progress row.

Live following stays enabled across large incoming blocks until the user scrolls
away. A wheel gesture that does not move the transcript does not detach it; moving
up to read earlier output still does. Wheel ownership is captured before native
scrolling, including when the browser would otherwise deliver React's passive
wheel callback after the viewport has moved. Returning to the bottom or using the
scroll arrow restores follow. Scrolling inside an independent nested panel keeps
the transcript's existing ownership. Completed text also replaces stale hydrated
segments, so the displayed response matches the provider's authoritative message.

Search waits for the list's measured message jump before centering the exact match.
A newer jump, user input in the transcript pane, closing search, or unmounting the
conversation cancels that pending centering step instead of moving the reader later.

### App-server protocol

Verified with codex-cli **0.155.1**, its generated experimental TypeScript schemas,
and an isolated native app-server session:

- `request_user_input_async` is a model-facing tool, not a client RPC. It emits
  `item/started` and `item/completed` for an `agentMessage` with
  `delivery: "async"` and `questions: [{ title, options }]`, and immediately
  returns to the agent. `options` may be null for a free-text-only question.
- The answer is an ordinary user message containing the questions and answers.
  Synara uses its existing turn dispatch: `turn/steer` with `expectedTurnId` while
  a turn is active, and `turn/start` once the turn has finished. The existing
  dispatch path also handles the turn finishing while the answer is being sent.
- This differs from `item/tool/requestUserInput`, which carries a JSON-RPC request
  ID and uses a response with an answer map. Its `isBlocking` field and deprecated
  `autoResolutionMs` do not define the native asynchronous tool's answer path.
  The inline asynchronous cards never enter Synara's pending approval/input queues.
- Synara does not force a model or enable experimental model features. Older
  app-server versions retain their existing text and blocking-question behavior;
  malformed structured questions fall back to the provider's message text.

Scope: native Codex questions in a top-level conversation. Other providers and
subagent question routing are outside this implementation.
